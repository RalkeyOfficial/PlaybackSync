# Missing Features Report — OLD vs CURRENT (backend + dashboard only)

Comparison of features documented in `OLD_CODE/docs/` against the current `docs/` and `agent-os/specs/`. Browser-extension features are excluded — backend (PHP / Nextcloud app, WebSocket sync daemon) and dashboard/admin panel only.

## Truly absent (no Phase 1/2 mention)

- **Prometheus metrics** (`/metrics`, `playbacksync_*` gauges/counters). OLD §10. Absent from current docs and roadmap.
- **Global per-room broadcast flood control.** OLD §8 had both per-connection *and* global rate limits — current `docs/ws-sync-server.md` only mentions per-connection (`ws_rate_limit_events_per_sec`).
- **Graceful shutdown / `SERVER_SHUTDOWN` message.** OLD broadcast a notice on SIGTERM. Current accepts "daemon restart drops connections, clients reconnect" as a design tradeoff — but no graceful-close path is specified.
- **WebSocket test harness** (`scripts/test-harness.js` from OLD §14). Phase 1 has PHPUnit but no multi-client WS simulator.
- **Resource budget estimates** (CPU/RAM/disk per room). OLD §15.

## Deferred per current roadmap (not gaps, just FYI)

- **Public share endpoint** `GET /r/{uuid}` with Basic Auth gate — Phase 2 in `docs/README.md`.
- **Participant list / live presence in API** — Phase 2 spec `agent-os/specs/2026-05-09-1900-rooms-api-live-state/`.
- **`last_state` DB column** (cached playback state) — Phase 2 migration noted in `docs/architecture.md`.
- **Token-based auth** (replace password-in-URL). OLD §17 future work.
- **Live playback controls in dashboard** — OLD itself marked this out of v1.
- **Event log surfaced in UI** — exists server-side as in-memory ring buffer, no API exposure yet.

## Intentionally dropped/redesigned (worth confirming)

- **`COMMAND` message type** → folded into STATE.
- **`TIME_REPORT`** → replaced by HEARTBEAT carrying `currentPos`.
- **`MEMBER_JOINED`/`MEMBER_LEFT` broadcasts** — current `docs/ws-sync-server.md` explicitly says no client-facing presence.
- **Public ACK/NACK protocol** — kept as internal server concept only.
- **Standalone Node.js Docker service** → replaced by `occ playbacksync:ws-serve` PHP daemon.

## Recommendations to address

If you want parity with the OLD design's operational story, the highest-value items to add to the roadmap are:

1. **Graceful shutdown semantics** — at minimum document the contract (e.g. clients receive close code X and reconnect with backoff).
2. **Metrics story** — even if not Prometheus, document what's observable.

Resolved since this file was first written:

- **Kick endpoint** — `DELETE /api/v1/rooms/{uuid}/clients/{clientId}` is now wired end-to-end (PHP controller → HMAC loopback → daemon `KickController`) with a per-client reconnect block (`ws_kick_block_ms`, default 30 s) and a `KICKED` error frame on the way out. See `agent-os/specs/2026-05-10-1415-connected-client-kick/`.
- **Healthcheck endpoint** — daemon now exposes unauthenticated `GET /healthz` on the loopback admin port (`ws_admin_port`, default 8766) returning aggregate counters (active rooms, connected clients, uptime, tick freshness) plus daemon version. Single-path carve-out evaluated before the HMAC check; response carries no UUIDs / client IDs / secrets. A public `GET /api/v1/health` (`#[PublicPage]`) loopback-passthrough route surfaces the same body wrapped with a reachability envelope so external probes (k8s, status pages) can hit a stable Nextcloud URL — always returns HTTP 200, daemon trouble surfaces as `status: "degraded"`. Bonus: `/api/v1/ws/status` was refactored to actually probe the daemon (it previously only checked install-state) and now distinguishes `not_installed` from `not_running` so the dashboard surfaces a warning state with restart guidance instead of misleadingly reporting "available". See `agent-os/specs/2026-05-10-1530-ws-daemon-healthcheck/`.
